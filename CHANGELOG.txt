Stylet Changelog
================

v1.1.7
------

 - Fix issue where OnInitialActivate may not be invoked if Screen was deactivated before being activated
 - Action s:Action to be instantiated with zero parameters
 - Make Stylet more modular by removing dependency on Application.Current from WindowManager, and View.ViewManager static property

v1.1.6
------

 - s:Action supports a wider range of events (including KeyDown)
 - Display a clearer message if the user tries to display a Window using s:View.Model

v1.1.5
------
 
  - Improve memory usage in StyletIoC
  - Avoid potential small memory leak in MessageBoxView
  - Improve Stylet.Samples.Validation

v1.1.4
------

 - Add support for DepencencyPropertyChangedEventHandler to Actions
 - Add OnStateChanged hook to Screen
 - Re-arrange ViewManager slightly to make it easier to override
 - Make the MessageBox display properly with multi-line content and an icon
 - WindowManager stes window title if it's the same as the window name (which is the default, set by the VS template)
 - Add InverseInstance to BoolToVisibilityConverter

v1.1.3
------

 - Fix issue where actions may not fire. Rare case caused by fix from v1.1.2.

v1.1.2
------

 - Avoid potential memory leak caused CommandAction and EventAction using DependencyPropertyDescriptor.AddValueChanged
 - StyletIoC registers IContainer with the builder by default

v1.1.1
------

 - WindowManager.ShowWindow/ShowDialog won't create a new View for the ViewModel if one is already attached
 - Add DisposeChildren to IConductor
 - Improve error message when WindowManager.ShowWindow/ShowDialog is used to show something that isn't a Window
 - Minor semantic fixes and code coverage improvements

v1.1.0
------

 - Backwards-incompatible changes to Bootstrapper: Configure is now called *after* ConfigureIoC, OnStart came before ConfigureIoC, and OnLaunch now happens after Launch
 - Screen now uses a property enum-based state machine to manage state. IActivate, IDeactivate and IClose have all been rolled into IScreenState
 - Fix incorrect use of WeakEventManager in ScreenExtensions: ConductWith won't have been working properly
 - Set WindowStartupLocation to CenterOwner if the user hasn't set it themselves
 - WindowManager does not set the Title binding (to DisplayName) if it's been set by the user
 - Actions throw on execute if ActionTarget hasn't changed from the default. This catches an edge-case where Actions are used inside something like a ContextMenu which breaks the visual tree
 - 

v1.0.7
------

 - Expand IViewManager to add other useful stuff, which ViewManager did anyway
 - Conductors now optionally dispose their children, and the WindowManager never does. This is to handle ViewModels which are displayed multiple times e.g. as dialogs
 - Conductors now ensure new children are either activated or deactivated. This is to handle child ViewModels which may have been closed previously
 - Make BootstrapperBase non-generic, instead having an abstract RootViewModel property. This makes it more flexible.
 - Handle null/empty property name in ValidatingModelBase.ValidatePropertyAsync

v1.0.6
------

 - Actions can handle attached events

v1.0.5
------

 - Code analysis improvements (StyleCop and ReSharper)
 - Work around error when showing multiple dialogs after main window has been closed
 - Actions unwrap TargetInvocationException, showing the user the actual exception and stack trace
 - Accept any (reasonable) event signature for event Actions, not just RoutedEventHandler
 - Bootstrapper disposes its container on exit

v1.0.4
------

 - Allow IModelValidator to return an IEnumerable<string> rather than a string[]
 - Fix up BindableCollection to be thread-safe
 - View name resolution is now a bit smarter
 - Add design time support
 - Add design time sample
 - Add sample bootstrapper which does not use an IoC container
 - Execute.OnXXX is synchronous by default in unit tests and design time: Execute.TestExecuteSynchronously has been removed

v1.0.3
------

 - Remove LambdaComparer and LambdaEqualityComparer - they don't really have a place in a UI framework
 - Have different default PropertyChanged and CollectionChanged dispatchers

v1.0.2
------

 - Move back to separate arguments for ShowMessageBox - this is more consistent with MessageBox.Show
 - ViewManager now accepts an IViewManagerConfig (implemented by BootstrapperBase), which simplifies the IoC container setup
 - Add an overridable CanClose() method to screen (called by the CanCloseAsync version by default). This means screens don't have to deal with tasks if they're fully synchronous

v1.0.1
------

 - Remove the IoC static service locator. It's no longer needed internally, and I don't want to encourage such bad behaviour. You can write your own easily if you need - see the docs
 - Remove the static AssemblySource class, instead using a collection stored on the Bootstrapper
 - Add Bootstrappers projects, with sample bootstrappers for a range of IoC containers
 - Remove extension methods on IContainer, instead putting them in the interface. This means people don't have to have 'using StyletIoC' in order to see the methods they want to use

v1.0.0
------

 - Logging improvements
 - ViewManager improvements
 - Revamp how the bootloader is added to the Application - it's a lot cleaner now
 - Conductors will dispose their children if they're IDisposable
 - StyletIoC updates: automatic Func registrations, refactoring, bug fixes, instance binding

-------

 - Add Execute.PostToUIThreadAsync
 - Rename ILogger and LogManager to not conflict in projects also using NLog

v0.9.10
-------

 - Add the concept of Channels to the EventAggregator
 - Remove the WeakEventManager (as it was too complex), and replace with an easier to use (but less powerful) implementation
 - Simplify IViewManager
 - Add logging to important parts of Stylet
 - Fix bug where Actions could throw exceptions when they shouldn't

------
