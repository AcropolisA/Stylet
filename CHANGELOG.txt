Stylet Changelog
================

v1.0.3
------

 - Remove LambdaComparer and LambdaEqualityComparer - they don't really have a place in a UI framework
 - Have different default PropertyChanged and CollectionChanged dispatchers

v1.0.2
------

 - Move back to separate arguments for ShowMessageBox - this is more consistent with MessageBox.Show
 - ViewManager now accepts an IViewManagerConfig (implemented by BootstrapperBase), which simplifies the IoC container setup
 - Add an overridable CanClose() method to screen (called by the CanCloseAsync version by default). This means screens don't have to deal with tasks if they're fully synchronous

v1.0.1
------

 - Remove the IoC static service locator. It's no longer needed internally, and I don't want to encourage such bad behaviour. You can write your own easily if you need - see the docs
 - Remove the static AssemblySource class, instead using a collection stored on the Bootstrapper
 - Add Bootstrappers projects, with sample bootstrappers for a range of IoC containers
 - Remove extension methods on IContainer, instead putting them in the interface. This means people don't have to have 'using StyletIoC' in order to see the methods they want to use

v1.0.0
------

 - Logging improvements
 - ViewManager improvements
 - Revamp how the bootloader is added to the Application - it's a lot cleaner now
 - Conductors will dispose their children if they're IDisposable
 - StyletIoC updates: automatic Func registrations, refactoring, bug fixes, instance binding
